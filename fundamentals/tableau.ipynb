    "**Tableau Prep -** Software used to combine, shape, clean, and automate data prep flows. Data cleaned from Tableau prep is a data source (or can be) for Tableau Desktop\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tableau Desktop -** Software that provides the ability to create interactive workbooks and dashboards as well as advanced AI-driven statistical modeling and more. Tableau Desktop by itself creates static content (i.e. files) that can only be accessed either through Tableau Desktop itself or through Tableau Reader and/or Viewer. See image below for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tableau Server -** Allows users to publish, share, and administer Tablesu desktop content thorughout an organization. A Tableau Server has an administrator who controls over the access to server content (that is, Tableau Desktop content published in the Tableau Server) to help protect sensitive data. A Tableau Server administrator can set user permissions on projects, workbooks, views, and data sources.\n",

When Tableau recognizes this type of data, it automatically assigns fields appropriate geographic roles, so they become geographic fields. If Tableau doesn't recognize your data as geogrphic, you can manually do so from the data point drop down menu (select geographic role and asign as necessary). \n",

    "\n",
    "A parameter is a workbook variable such as a number, date, or string that can replace a constant value in a calculation, filter, or reference line.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you may create a calculated field that returns True if Sales is greater than $500,000 and otherwise returns False. You can replace the constant value of “500_000” in the formula with a parameter. Then, using the parameter control, you can dynamically change the threshold in your calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bottom line is, paramaters are akin to variables in programming that can be adjusted in real-time by the user.**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can even create a dynamic parameter that’s set to automatically refresh its current value (to the result of a single-value, view-independent calculation), list of values (based on a data source column), or range of values. This will happen each time the workbook is opened and Tableau connects to the data source referenced by the parameter, or whenever you select Refresh from the data source’s context menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make your parameters more dynamic and interactive by using them in **Parameter Actions**. Parameter actions let your audience change a parameter value through direct interaction with a viz, such as clicking or selecting a mark.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four standard use cases for parameters:\n",

    "* Reference Lines\n",
    "* Calculated Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameters by themselves DO NOTHING!!! All they are are potential value placeholders, think variable. In order to use them, you must creat a calculated field that INCLUDES the paramter.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have an example of this in my credit-scores Workbook that allows user to enter a desired id and then get the returned values. (This could be filtered, however, there IS NOT filter that allows users to type in values). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of great things you can do within Tableau Desktop to add interactivity. You can even add combinations of these elements for really cool features. They break down into four basic varieties: \n",
    "\n",
    "**GLOBAL FILTERS:**  are standard filters that are created from one of the views in your desktop and then applied to more than the original worksheet. The term global filter implies that the filter affects every single view in that dashboard, but that’s not necessarily the case. They could apply to as little as two views, the original view and another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PARAMETERS:** Parameters are one of the most powerful elements in Tableau Desktop, because they can be used in a lot of different cases. Here are the main ones: calculated fields, histogram bins, reference lines, top N filters, and customized table calculations. With all of these options, parameters can do all sorts of things, including completely swapping out the measures and dimensions in your view. This is how you can add multiple views within a single visualization with just a single parameter control.\n",
    "\n",
    "**DASHBOARD ACTIONS:** Dashboard actions are unique features for dashboards. They allow worksheets the ability to interact outside of just the domain of their view. There are three types of dashboard actions: filter actions, highlight actions, and URL actions. These are created and accessed throgh Dashboard ---> Actions ---> Add Action\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Filter Actions -** allow the selections in one vizulazation to affect others. This can even be used to navigate between different dashboards\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Highlight Actions -** allow you to emphasize the marks in other visualizations by interacting with the source worksheet The highlight will appear in the same visual style as the Highlighter tool or clicking on a value in the color legend\n",
    "\n",
    "* **URL Actions -** help the user navigate to a web address from within the dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "**TOOLTIPS:** are details that appear when you rest the pointer over one or more marks in the view\n",
